## Development server

Before anything, install node.js 16.19.0. You may need to restart your computer. Then, with the console opened in the project directory, run `npm i`.
Now run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
